# Changelog

## v0.1.27 (2026-02-26)

  conversation list and viewer, making it easier to find named sessions
- Search preview shows matches better now

## v0.1.26 (2026-02-18)

- Added `global = true` config option to default to global search without
  passing `-g` every time, with `--local` flag to override when needed

  lists, code blocks, tables) and wrap long lines instead of overflowing
- Fixed high idle CPU usage (~9% down to near zero) when the TUI was sitting
  idle after loading

  search phrase

## v0.1.24 (2026-02-11)
